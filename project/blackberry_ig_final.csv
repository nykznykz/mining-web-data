We invented much of what the smart phone is today and we built one of the world’s most globally recognized brands. But more than that, we developed a strong emotional connection with our customers that persists even today. You love us. 
But the market changed. Apple introduced the iPhone. Google brought Android to market. Suddenly competition was everywhere and moving fast. We weren’t fast enough. We lost our grip and fell behind. But all the while we continued to innovate in connected security and mobility, especially in software rather than hardware. 
That’s when our board brought in a new CEO. John Chen joined us as our leader in 2013 after a very successful stint turning around Sybase. He recognized our legacy and believed that BlackBerry could be a leader again, but this time by taking advantage of our software, security and mobility assets and phasing out the in-house manufacturing, distribution and marketing of handsets.

Our mechanical engineers pushed the limits of materials and processes to provide an uncompromised all-touch experience, with the added benefit of a physical keyboard. Using materials such as woven glass composite, the team successfully packed an impressive 3410mAh battery into a slider form factor thinner than some competitive full-touch devices. This was truly a technical feat which enabled a compelling industrial design.

I believe this is measured through the surprise users get when they reveal the keypad for the first time. The form is uninterrupted except for a small step at the bottom of the device, providing visual and ergonomic affordance to indicate where the display slides, magically exposing the touch-sensitive keyboard.
