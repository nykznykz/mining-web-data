Music: “WOMAN'S WORLD” by @_OKENYO_
Lyrics: Wear my suit
Wear my hat on frontways
The back professes some slogan sayin' companies that really own me
Wear my tie right up to the neck
Exhaling excellence
Peace out, I'm la-de-da, blah blah to the executives
I'm a very busy woman with a lot on my plate
So you better eat it up before I take it away
It's a woman's world"
